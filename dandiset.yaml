description: "Here we present a fluorescence microscope light path that enables imaging,
  during free behavior, of thousands of neurons in mice and hundreds of neurons in
  juvenile songbirds. The light path eliminates traditional illumination optics, allowing
  for head-mounted microscopes that have both a lower weight and a larger field of
  view (FOV) than previously possible. Using this light path, we designed two microscopes:
  one optimized for FOV (~4 mm FOV; 1.4 g), and the other optimized for weight (1.0
  mm FOV; 1.0 g). \nThis dataset includes the calcium imaging data from our microscope
  optimized for weight. For this experiment, we stereotactically located a region
  of the mouse brain at coordinates associatied with primary visual and somatosensory
  regions, performed approximately 20 viral injections of GCaMP7f across a 4-mm-diameter
  region of cortex, and then implanted a 4-mm-diameter glass window in the skull.
  After letting each mouse recover, we installed our head-mounted microscope and allowed
  it to freely explore a circular maze while recording calcium activity for several
  minutes."
